# Jin's Pleasure Bot

A Discord bot that spouts posts from [r/AnimeGirls](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeGirls "r/AnimeGirls") and [r/CuteAnimeGirls](https://www.reddit.com/r/CuteAnimeGirls "r/CuteAnimeGirls"); made as a joke for a friend in a day with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and [PRAW](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw). (help)

The origin of this project came from a conversation with two friends as I was glancing at [an article teaching readers how to wrtie a Discord bot with Python and Repl.it](https://www.codementor.io/@garethdwyer/building-a-discord-bot-with-python-and-repl-it-miblcwejz "Building a Discord Bot with Python and Repl.it by Gareth Dwyer"). It can be invoked with `!qtgrls`, and then sends a message containing the title and URL of ~~the latest new submission on r/AnimeGirls~~ a random submission from either r/AnimeGirls or r/CuteAnimeGirls. The bot only listens to messages in a specific channel and features a custom status that reminds users of the command. Overall, since I made it in a few hours with no prior knowledge ~~and I made the friends in my Discord server cringe~~, I'm quite proud of myself.

Made with <3 via Python 3.8.2 and [Repl.it](repl.it).
